On the way to the Flughafen, a man ran into a friend.
His friend was a connoisseur of Döner, a jolly fellow.
The friend was leaning against a red Porsche while eating a mini Apfelkuchen, and waved as the man approached.
The friend was wearing a Lederhose and a button down shirt, and had his Hund in his car
When the man got close enough, the friend asked, "Have you been to the new bäckerei on Hauptstrasse?"
He responded that he had and that he had tried their Brot that had just been freshly made
To the Biergarten they went, and with their money they payed.
As they chatted, the scent of freshly baked Gebäck wafted from the Porsche.
The man realized that he was going to be late for his flight, so he rushed to his BMW
